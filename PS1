*b, The basic results on racial discrimination are summarized in Table 4. Replicate numbers in panel A of this table.

tab race h, sum(call) mean
 
summarize call if race == "w" & l == 1
summarize call if race == "w" & h == 1
summarize call if race == "b" & l == 1
summarize call if race == "b" & h == 1

* Calculate total callbacks and total observations by race and resume quality
egen total_calls = total(call), by(race h)
egen total_obs = count(call), by(race h)

* Calculate callback rates by race and resume quality
gen callback_rate = total_calls / total_obs * 100

* Display the results
list race h callback_rate if !missing(race) & !missing(h), noobs clean

* Collapse the dataset to calculate mean and median callback rates by race and resume quality
collapse (mean) mean_callback_rate = callback_rate, by(race h)

* Display the results using list
list race h mean_callback_rate

*generate variables with years of experience adjusted for the table, and a squared var

*generating binary variable for gender and city  
encode sex, gen(sex_binary) label("1 if female")
encode city, gen(city_binary) label("1 if chicago")

*generating binary variables for the 6 occupation dummies

*e) Table 5 does not report the marginal effects of experience properly: experience is treated as unrelated to experience squared. Fix this; account for the fact that a change in experience implies a change in experience squared.
